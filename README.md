### Low Robustness of Quantum Devices
The quantum devices available currently are not sophisticated enough to generate qubits with very high generation rate and to maintain their quantum properties long enough.

### Loss of Entangled States and Quantum Data
The current transport layer protocols discard entangled states and quantum data under congestion.

### Advanced Quantum Retransmission Protocols
Existing protocols rerquire two successful transmissions to complete data sharing, even in scenarios without any packet loss.
