## Quantum Network

### Quantum Network Protocols upon link level
[1] A Link Layer Protocol for Quantum Networks, SIGCOMM '19: ACM SIGCOMM 2019 Conference.

The autor propose a functional allocation of a quantum network
stack, and construct the first physical and link layer protocols that
turn ad-hoc physics experiments producing heralded entanglement
between quantum processors into a well-defined and robust service.

The code is opensourced in https://github.com/SoftwareQuTech/QLinkLayerSimulations .

### Quantum Multi-parties Entanglement Routing
[1] Multiparty entanglement routing in quantum networks, Physical Review A, 2023.
The author proposed a protocol for extracting maximally entangled GHZ States for any numbers of parties in a quantum network.
The network had been abstracted as a graph state and local operations has been abstracted as Graph Operations.
